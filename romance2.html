            <p>
              "Come in, Maeve," Desmond O'Brian called with a broad grin that
              underscored his confident demeanor. He casually beckoned her over
              with his arm as he sat at one of the tables.
            </p>
            <p>
              Maeve quickly served the drip coffee she had just prepared and
              then hurried back to the restaurant.<br />
              "Please, Mr. O'Brian," she said softly, her voice almost a
              whisper, reflecting her Irish Catholic reserve. Desmond raised an
              eyebrow. His gaze remained friendly, but carried a hint of
              challenge. "Sit down, Maeve. We have something to discuss." He
              gestured to the chair next to him. <br />
              Maeve hesitated, then carefully sat down on the edge of the chair.
              Her heart pounded. Was he dissatisfied with her work? Was she
              about to be fired? Nervously, she smoothed her apron as she tried
              to organize her thoughts.
              <br />
              "Listen, Sheila's out for a while. Now I urgently need a
              replacement for inside. And that's when I thought of you."
              Desmond's voice was relaxed, but a certain determination flashed
              in his eyes. "It's different, of course, working inside, but I've
              been watching you for the last few weeks. You've got what it
              takes. And," he smiled wickedly, "there's more money, too." Maeve
              wasn't sure what to make of his offer. Hesitantly, she pointed up
              the oak stairs. "You mean upstairs?" she swallowed. The mere
              thought of it was visibly taking its toll on her, so that her
              voice was barely audible above a whisper.
              <br />
              "No, not upstairs," Desmond said quickly, his voice softening,
              almost soothing. "You don't have to do that. You're not the type
              for that. It's just down here, serving food and drinks. That's
              basically it. But I expect you to adapt a little more to our
              operation." He smiled broadly. "I'll tell Patricia to take you
              under her wing starting tomorrow."<br />
              Maeve nodded slowly, her expression relaxing slightly. "Okay," she
              said quietly, her relief evident. "I'll do it, boss." Desmond
              stood up, but before he left, he placed his hand on her shoulder,
              loosely but with a certain warmth. <br />
              "I knew it. We Irish people have to stick together, don't we?" His
              voice became even friendlier. "Oh, by the way, drop the 'Mr.'.
              From now on, I'm Desmond to you." He winked at her, and Maeve
              couldn't help but smile back. With that, he left the surprised
              Maeve in the restaurant while he climbed the stairs to his office.
            </p>
            <p>
              At dinner in their small, modest home, Maeve told her little
              brother Rian about the incident. She felt him glued to her lips
              expectantly as she told him about her promotion. Rian drummed his
              fork on his plate and grinned broadly. "Great, then we can finally
              have some bacon with our soda bread again, right?" His eyes shone
              with joy, and he hugged Maeve tightly. Maeve returned the hug with
              a warmth that only a big sister could give. She stroked his brown
              hair lovingly.
              <br />
              "Let's see," she said gently, pressing a tender kiss to his
              forehead. "I don't know exactly how much more I'll get, but
              whatever it is, I'm happy for us." Her voice was full of hope.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rian was her pride and joy, the one her entire life revolved
              around. Since her mother passed away last year, Maeve felt
              obligated to do everything she could to protect and care for her
              little brother. He was only ten years old. She, on the other hand,
              would be coming of age in a year. Therefore, she was also the
              support, the love, and the strength of this little family.<br />
              "Say the prayer," Maeve urged Rian as she knelt next to him on the
              narrow bed, wearing her simple gray dress. They clasped their
              hands together, and Maeve closed her eyes to pray for her brother
              and herself. <br />
              "God, be with me this night. Protect me with your power. Give me
              peace and rest, and awaken me anew in the morning. And thank you,
              Mr. O'Brian," she heard Rian say. He recited the prayer with a
              childlike sincerity that touched Maeve deeply.
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            <p>
              <img
                style="border-radius: 50%"
                width="150px"
                height="150px"

                alt=""
              />
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            <p>
              After the prayer, both of them crawled into the only bed available
              to them, exhausted from the day. It was small, but it was their
              sanctuary to relax. Maeve took one last look around the room: the
              small beech table with two simple wooden chairs and the shelf on
              the wall where they had stored the few belongings they owned.
              Through the door to the room, she could see the mirror above the
              sink in the small adjoining room, reflecting the cast-iron coal
              stove they used for cooking and heating.
            </p>
            <p>
              She was too tired to go downstairs to the communal restroom. So
              she turned off the light and hoped to fall asleep soon. But the
              thought of Rian's prayer and the hope for better days wouldn't
              leave her alone. "Thank you, Mr. O'Brian," she repeated the part
              of the prayer. Yes, Desmond. O'Brian was the only safe haven she
              had here in Manhattan, she was becoming increasingly aware of
              this. She had taken over her mother's position as seamstress in
              the textile factory when her health no longer allowed her to work
              the 10-hour shifts. However, in the factory, she was just one
              among many seamstresses, and if a worker was absent, she was
              immediately replaced by another. The work pressure was high, and
              at times Maeve felt like a machine.
            </p>
            <p>
              Things were different at Desmond O'Brian's. There, she felt the
              joy of the guests when she looked after them, and they almost
              always gave her tips. Therefore, it didn't bother her that she had
              already put in 50 hours of work when she started her weekend shift
              as a server at Desmond's restaurant-bar. The work there filled her
              heart with so much joy that she was happy to run from the kitchen
              to the terrace and back countless times.
            </p>
            <p>
              Desmond was also from Ireland, and that must have been the reason
              why he had hired her back then, despite what felt like a botched
              interview. And now she'd even been promoted. Her hard work and
              loving helpfulness had paid off. Maeve pushed her head deeper into
              the pillow and fell into a restful sleep. <br />
              The next day, a Sunday, she arrived at O'Brian's Restaurant-Bar
              half an hour earlier than usual. Patricia stood in the doorway,
              lighting a cigarette. She had been working for Desmond for some
              time, was blonde, tall, and outrageously self-confident. <br />The
              next day, a Sunday, she appeared. "I have no idea why Desmond
              chose you," Patricia's gaze slid down Maeve's head, "but in here,
              you have to learn a few rules first. So, I'll serve all the tables
              up to the fourth row, the remaining three rows are your
              responsibility. Is that clear?"
            </p>
            <p>
              Maeve wanted to appear confident at all costs, but felt
              intimidated by Patricia. She replied curtly, "Sure.
              Understood."<br />
              "Oh, one more thing," Patricia continued her lecture, "you can't
              walk around here like that. You have to offer the guests
              something, so that they'll want to come back. You have to wear
              your skirt and apron at least a hand's width higher so that more
              leg is visible. And you should leave the button placket on your
              blouse," Patricia began unbuttoning Maeve's blouse, "half open,
              too." <br />
              Maeve was feeling extremely uncomfortable by now, but she didn't
              dare contradict Patricia. So she followed the instructions, hoping
              that would be the end of it. But she was wrong, because Patricia
              now pointed her index finger toward the bar and explained, "In
              here, we don't just serve ice cream, coffee, and non-alcoholic
              Near Beer, like Bevo. The difference between the terrace and this
              is that guests here also get spirits. Spirits, whiskey, rum, gin,
              and various cocktails, everything that makes an evening truly
              enjoyable."
            </p>
            <p>
              Maeve stared at her. "But Prohibition," she blurted out. But
              Patricia interrupted her sharply. "Forget Prohibition. It doesn't
              apply in here. We're a speakeasy, you understand? We serve what
              our customers want. It's logical, right?"<br />
              Shocked, Maeve pressed her hand over her mouth, as if to suppress
              any mispronounced words. The color drained from her face. So that
              was why they paid higher salaries here. Selling alcohol in New
              York was illegal, that was well known, and now she too was being
              prosecuted? Maeve was shocked.
              <br />
              Patrica had turned back toward the counter to tell Maeve about the
              security measures in place when she heard a loud bang and
              reflexively turned around. Maeve had slumped and fallen onto a
              chair.
            </p>
            <h3>Chapter 2</h3>
            <p>
              Desmond approached Maeve with a serious expression. "Pat said
              there were problems?" But she just stared ahead. So Desmond
              decided to send Patricia back to work so he could calmly address
              Maeve.
              <br /><br />
              "Now, Maeve," he asked her calmly, almost fatherly. "What's wrong,
              girl?" <br />"You didn't tell me that I should serve alcohol," she
              sadly dropped her head and her hands. "I'm an honest person, I
              want to do honest work." <br />Desmond examined her closely, then
              he began in a reassuring tone, "Look, Maeve, I can understand you.
              I'm Irish too. I spent my childhood in Belfast. You don't have to
              explain to me how the Irish think. We are a staunchly Catholic,
              hardworking, and pious people. And we can be proud of that, even
              if the Americans don't see it that way. They think we're poor,
              lazy, drunkards, criminals, and prone to violence." He paused
              briefly.<br />
              "We all left Ireland because the country couldn't feed us. The
              many famines, the lack of prospects. None of us emigrated for pure
              pleasure. It was the hope of a new future that motivated us. We
              wanted things to be better for ourselves and our children."
              Another pause followed.
              <br />
              Desmond put his arm on her shoulder, like a friend's. "Maeve, has
              anything changed for you since then? You're just fighting here to
              survive. Otherwise, you wouldn't have shown up at my
              restaurant-bar back then, working extra weekends. You've told me
              your life story, but it's probably not much different than that of
              most Irish people who live here in the Tenderloin, Hell's Kitchen,
              or Five Points.
              <br /><br />
              <img

              /><br /><br />
              They all live in disastrous conditions, work all day, and don't
              know how to make ends meet in the evening. Isn't that right?" He
              looked at Maeve, who nodded in agreement.
              <br /><br />
              "You probably have one of those shitty 10-hour contracts in one of
              the industrial plants here, which leaves too much to die for and
              too little to live for. Watch out, if you work for me all week
              instead of just Saturdays and Sundays, I'll pay you more than you
              get in the damn factory. And think of all the nice tips the guests
              give you on top. I saw on the terrace how popular you are with
              them. That'll get you by just fine and you can even save up an
              emergency fund. What do you think?"<br />
              Desmond sensed that she wasn't quite convinced yet and spoke
              again. "In a foreign country, it's important to follow its rules,
              that's true. But what are the rules here in the Tenderloin?
              Haven't you noticed that in this part of town, almost all the
              restaurants are speakeasies, i.e., places to sell alcohol? Some
              also sell drugs, or, like us, girls." <br /><br />
              Do you think that would be possible if everything was under
              prohibition? The secret of it all is that you have to get the
              authorities on board. Then the system works. And we pay the local
              police officers a lot of kickbacks so that they let us do what we
              want. But if the police are already involved, then what we're
              doing can't be that illegal, do you think?" He turned back to
              Maeve.<br />
              "But didn't God..." Maeve began, but Desmond immediately completed
              the sentence himself. "Didn't God say, take from the rich and give
              to the poor? Maeve, God doesn't want you to go to the dogs here.
              Recognize that." He hugged her comfortingly. "God said I'm giving
              you Irish a new chance in America. This is the land of
              opportunity. So have the courage to take your life into your own
              hands and make something of it. I, for example, came to Manhattan
              about two years ago, and look at what I've built up here. I didn't
              have a penny in my pocket and now I run several bars in the
              Tenderloin.<br /><br />

              Maeve, we're here to climb the ladder of success. So be brave and
              make something of your life. And one more thing to reassure you.
              The authorities are almost never interested in waitresses. They
              wanted to get the big fish, not the good-natured crumbs."
              <br /><br />
              Desmond's words echoed past Maeve's ears. She seemed to barely
              register the arguments her boss was using to convince her.
              Desmond's presence, his voice, and his touch brought back familiar
              memories of her father. Back when she was a child, he had also so
              warmly embraced her and comforted her when she wasn't feeling
              well. She felt herself letting go. How her tension eased as the
              feeling of security from old times returned. Although she smiled
              at Desmond, she couldn't suppress a large tear. How much she
              missed her father, who had died in a shipyard accident in Belfast.
              She had been just six years old at the time.
              <br /><br />
              Desmond fatherly pulled a handkerchief from his suit and gently
              dried her cheek. "Well, you can laugh again," he encouraged her.
              "Listen, I'll make you a suggestion. I'll show you the security
              features we've installed for our protection, and then you can
              simply test out the new job for a day and see how you like it.
              Agreed?" He held out his hand and winked. "The high five," Maeve
              thought, "just like Dad." She couldn't help herself and
              automatically accepted. The deal was done.
              <br /><br />
              After Desmond showed her the safety buttons for the warning
              systems installed throughout the restaurant, Maeve seemed finally
              convinced. One press of a safety button was enough to light up a
              small electric candle at each table, warning guests. At the same
              time, the back bar, with all the alcohol, sank silently into the
              floor and was thus no longer visible to third parties. Desmond had
              installed the technology himself, and it was truly brilliant,
              especially since various safety buttons were distributed
              throughout the room and could therefore be activated quickly.
              <br /><br />
              Desmond pulled his car keys out of his pocket. Then he called to
              the two waitresses, "Patricia, Maeve, you'll get it done! I don't
              want to hear any complaints," and left the restaurant laughing.
              <br /><br />
              Maeve stood at the counter, her eyes intently fixed on Patricia.
              She knew that she had worked there for years and was known for her
              experience and skill. Patricia was essentially a quiet, reliable
              woman who knew everything, but Maeve was keen to build a warm
              relationship with her. A good working atmosphere was important to
              her. Patricia was writing the daily specials on a blackboard with
              chalk. Maeve quietly stepped to her side. With a warm smile, she
              asked, "May I help you, Patricia? Should I start arranging the
              flowers on the tables?" Patricia looked at Maeve for a moment,
              surprised, then nodded gratefully. "That would be very kind,
              Maeve. Thank you." <br /><br />
              Maeve took the tray of small vases, filled each one with a little
              water, and then trimmed the stem of each rose before placing it in
              a vase. She carefully balanced the tray of flower vases on her
              left hand and hurried from table to table, while her right hand
              skillfully placed one vase at a time. Her movements were careful
              and deliberate. She made sure the blossoms were arranged so that
              every guest would perceive them as a friendly greeting.
              <br /><br />
              It would be a while before the first guests arrived at the
              restaurant, as it always opened a little later than the outdoor
              terrace. Maeve wanted to use this time to learn more about her new
              role. She went to the bar, which was located to the left of the
              oak staircase. The metal surface of the counter gleamed, so
              carefully Joe had polished it. Now he was putting away the
              glasses. Maeve looked nervously at Joe and tugged at her fingers.
              <br /><br />
              The bartender was a tall, powerful man, whose deep dimples
              probably came from his permanent grin. Maeve took a deep breath
              and addressed him with a small smile. "Hi, I'm Maeve. I'm supposed
              to be serving inside from now on. I want to do everything right.
              To be honest, I know little about alcoholic drinks, but I'm very
              curious to learn more."<br />
              Joe looked over at her skeptically. "So you want to discover the
              secrets of the many bottles, eh? Okay, Maeve, I'll tell you
              something. But be careful, this isn't a piece of cake, even if it
              looks like it.“<br /><br />
              Maeve nodded eagerly. "I understand, I'm so excited. Please, can
              you explain the main cocktails to me? I want to know what people
              order here."<br />Joe grinned, his initial reluctance giving way
              to a slightly amused look. "Okay, Joe will tell you something. But
              only because you're so curious." He chuckled. "Let's start with a
              classic: the 'Bee's Knees.' It's made with honey, lemon juice, and
              gin. Sweet, but with a kick." Maeve laughed. "Honey in your drink?
              How delicious!"<br /><br />
              Joe grinned. "That's it. And then there's the 'Sidecar'. That's
              brandy, orange liqueur, and lemon juice. Very elegant, almost like
              a dance on the tongue." "Wow, that sounds great! Patricia said the
              'French 75' is especially popular. What's that?"
              <br />Joe nodded approvingly. "The 'French 75' is a real hit. Gin,
              champagne, lemon juice, and sugar syrup. It's like a little
              firework in a glass. Perfect for a night full of secrets."<br />
              Maeve seemed excited. "That's really exciting! Please tell me
              more. How do you make the 'Whiskey Sour'?"<br /><br />
              Joe started laughing. "The 'Whiskey Sour' is simple: whiskey,
              lemon juice, simple syrup, and sometimes a little egg white for
              the foam. It's rough and smooth at the same time, just like life
              here in the speakeasy."<br /><br />
              They looked at each other, both laughing, while Maeve asked more
              and more questions.
              <br /><br />
              "You see, Maeve, being a bartender isn't a black box. It's an art,
              and you have the spirit for it. Soon, you too will be mastering
              cocktails like a pro."
              <br />Maeve beamed. "Thanks, Joe! I'm looking forward to serving
              your cocktails to the guests!" "Yes, advertise me properly in the
              restaurant," he said, amused. "Together we'll increase sales."<br /><br />
              Now both of them shook with laughter. Meanwhile, Bessie Smith's
              song "Me and My Gin" played softly on the record player in the
              background, and the world outside seemed forgotten for a moment.
              Then the first guests entered, and Maeve hurried to greet them and
              escort them to their tables.
              <br /><br />
              When Desmond returned late that evening and took a look inside the
              restaurant, Maeve was already so familiar with the workings that
              it seemed as if she'd been working there her whole life. He knew
              then that she would stay.
              <br /><br />

            <h3>Chapter 3</h3>
            <p>
              The next day, Maeve was leaning against the bar with Joe again.
              Her eyes were fixed on the door, alert for any new guests
              entering. The restaurant was relatively quiet. There were hardly
              any guests present. Only the soft rustling of leaves outside and
              the occasional clatter of glasses and cutlery could be heard.
              Suddenly, Maeve noticed movement in the entryway. A white dove
              floated in through the open door, its wings flapping gently as it
              curiously explored its surroundings.<br /><br />
              Maeve immediately felt an inner excitement. She loved animals, and
              she knew the pigeon was probably just looking for some bread. With
              a loving smile on her lips, she slowly approached the pigeon,
              which hadn't been noticed by any guest yet. "Well, little one,
              what are you doing here?" Maeve whispered gently, carefully
              raising her hands so as not to frighten the pigeon.<br /><br />
              "Come on, I don't mean you any harm," she said encouragingly. Her
              voice was warm and soothing. "This is no place for you. Let's get
              you back outside." She moved cautiously so as not to scare the
              pigeon, trying to guide it gently toward the door. The pigeon
              fluttered a bit, but seemed to sense Maeve's calm demeanor and
              finally settled on her hand. Maeve smiled lovingly, gently stroked
              its soft feathers, and spoke softly, "You're so beautiful, little
              pigeon. Fly home now, okay?"<br />
              Just then, Desmond came out of his office. As always, he looked
              stunning: muscular, young, slightly tanned, and encased in a
              certain nonchalance. He had been observing the scene and now came
              over to help. "Hey, Maeve, do you need any assistance?" he asked
              with a friendly smile as he stood next to her.<br />
              Maeve looked at him gratefully. "I just wanted to get the pigeon
              back outside. It's so beautiful, but the restaurant isn't the
              right place for it." "Indeed," Desmond joked, "otherwise it might
              end up in the cooking pot." <br />
              Maeve gently stroked the feathers once more before carefully
              clasping the dove in both hands and carrying it toward the door.
              Desmond opened the door for her, and Maeve released the dove from
              her arms into the blue sky.<br />
              As Maeve and Desmond stood still for a moment, watching the
              pigeon, they felt a pleasant closeness to each other. No words
              were needed, just a smile, a look that said more than a thousand
              words. Maeve felt her heart beat a little faster. Then everyone
              went back to work.
              <br /><br />
              A while passed, then the door opened again. A young lady entered.
              She was probably no older than twenty-two, dressed in fashionable
              clothes, with an elegant, confident demeanor. Her face was
              beautiful, her eyes sparkling with joy and self-confidence. Maeve
              could hardly look away from her, she was so stunningly beautiful.
              <br /><br />
              With a radiant smile, the lady immediately attracted the attention
              of everyone present. Maeve admired the charisma she exuded, while
              at the same time feeling a little insecure as she caught herself
              wondering whether she could ever look so elegant. Desmond, who
              greeted the young woman with a gentle kiss, offered her his arm to
              accompany her to his office. "Honey, you made it right on time,"
              he said in his erotically masculine voice and kissed her hand.
              "I'm so happy to see you."
              <br />
              The lady smiled back, her eyes sparkling with joy. "I'm so happy
              to see you too, Desmond. How you have everything so well under
              control here." She glanced into the small restaurant, which was
              quite luxuriously decorated. <br />
              Maeve watched the scene in disbelief. She was impressed and yet a
              little envious at the same time. She felt a mixture of admiration
              and quiet longing as she watched the two disappear into the
              office. <br />
              Admiration for Desmond, who was obviously very happy, grew in her
              heart. She wondered what it would be like to have someone who
              loved and appreciated her so much. Maeve shook her head slightly
              to clear her thoughts and turned back to the restaurant.<br />
              She later learned from Patricia that the lady was Desmond's
              fiancée and that the wedding was imminent. Outside, the sun had
              already set when Maeve returned home.
              <br /><br />
              The next day, the restaurant was about a third full. The
              atmosphere was relaxed, and guests enjoyed their drinks and
              conversation.
              <br /><br />
              Then a middle-aged man entered the bar. He crept through the door
              almost imperceptibly, appearing inconspicuous and quiet. But Maeve
              immediately sensed that something was wrong with him. She felt a
              sense of unease rising within her. The man was simply dressed,
              which was nothing unusual for this area, but for a bar-goer, his
              posture seemed extremely tense. He repeatedly glanced around
              cautiously, as if he were searching for something. He sat down at
              one of Patricia's tables and glanced furtively toward the bar, as
              if he were waiting for something or watching someone.
              Occasionally, his hand slipped into his jacket pocket, where it
              fumbled for something.
              <br /><br />
              Although Maeve knew Patricia wasn't comfortable with her taking
              care of her guests, she approached the guest. "And, sir, what may
              I get you?" she asked politely, putting on a friendly face. "What
              do you have that's nice?" he wanted to know, but his voice sounded
              as if it were disguised.<br />
              "Well, the usual," Maeve began listing the drinks she had served
              on the patio, "Iced coffee, tea, near beer, milkshakes, drip
              coffee, espresso," you name it.<br />
              "Well, kid, then bring me a French 75," he blurted out, somewhat
              spitefully.<br />
              "Sorry, but we don't carry alcoholic beverages, Prohibition, you
              know," Maeve replied, gathering all her courage. <br />
              “Okay, then a malt drink,” the guest snapped.<br />
              “As the lord wishes,” Maeve completed the order and hurried to the
              bar. <br /><br />
              There, Patricia confronted her. "You've lost it! How dare you
              serve my guests," she snarled at Maeve, who had witnessed
              everything. But Maeve rushed past her to the counter, where she
              quickly ran her hand under the countertop to find the safety
              button. In an instant, she pressed it, triggering the secret
              warning signal.<br />
              Joe took a step back as the back bar sank into the ground at his
              feet, while electric candles began to glow at the many small
              tables in the restaurant.<br />
              Patricia was beside herself. "Are you serious?" she whispered to
              Maeve.
              <br />But Maeve breathed a sigh of relief. "Patricia, there's
              something wrong with your guest, believe me."<br />
              "He's a guest like any other," she snapped, "do you actually know
              what you've done here?"
              <br /><br />
              "Stop arguing," a harsh male voice sounded behind them. It was
              Desmond, who had also heard the security signal in his office and
              rushed down the stairs.<br />
              “The young lady sees white mice,” Patricia’s voice sounded
              contemptuous.
              <br /><br />
              "Okay, what's going on?" Desmond turned to Maeve. In a calm but
              quiet voice, she reported what she had noticed. Desmond cautiously
              scanned the restaurant's tables to get a closer look at the
              suspect and froze. Maeve was right. Desmond had seen the
              suspicious guest's face before. But where had it been?
              <br /><br />
              He rubbed his face with his hand. In his job, you had to have a
              good memory if you wanted to survive. And if Desmond had anything,
              it was just that: a photographic memory. Now it came back to him.
              He had seen that disgusting creature in front of the Bureau of
              Prohibition, engaged in conversation with the Sheriff. That was
              the building of the U.S. Treasury Department, which was
              responsible for enforcing the prohibition of alcohol.
              <br /><br />
              "Maeve," he took her hands, "Maeve, I think you just saved our
              asses." His eyes met hers with gratitude, and Maeve felt a deep
              connection.<br />
              Then Desmond decided: "Okay, let's move on. Pat, bring the dear
              guest some delicious malt liquor. Let's hope he disappears soon."
              <br /><br />
              There was much to suggest that disaster had been averted today by
              O'Brain's Bar, because when Patricia served him his drink, he
              didn't even touch it, but immediately paid and left the
              restaurant.<br />
              Maeve couldn't wait to return home that evening and tell Rian
              about this dangerous, yet adventurous, incident. As she left the
              restaurant after her shift, the sky had clouded over, and before
              they could even enter their apartment, heavy raindrops began to
              pour down on them.

              <br /><br />

            <h3>Chapter 4</h3>
            <p>
              In the gloomy Hell's Kitchen, where the shadows of the Irish slums
              hung like dark veils over the dilapidated houses, Maeve returned
              home that evening, soaked to the skin. The door creaked softly as
              she opened it, but despite the creaking wood, she heard the
              desperate groans of her little brother Rian. <br /><br />
              A terrible pain filled his breath, and Maeve's heart clenched in
              sympathy. She rushed into the small, stuffy room, where Rian lay
              on the bare floor, his right leg crooked and bleeding. The sight
              cut deep into her heart. Rian explained that a carriage had run
              over his leg. The leg was crushed, the skin torn, blood flowing in
              dark streams. Rian screamed in pain, his small hands clutching
              Maeve's sleeves as she hastily tended to him.<br /><br />
              With trembling hands, but full of determination, Maeve searched
              through what little they had. She remembered the old home remedies
              her mother had taught her back in Belfast. So she fetched a clean
              cloth and dipped it in hot water. It probably wasn't sterile, but
              it was the best they had in their situation. With careful
              movements, she wiped along the wound to remove the dirt and tried
              to ease her brother's pain. Then she reached for a piece of clean
              cloth and soaked it in vinegar, one of her few available
              disinfectants. With a trembling hand, she carefully dabbed the
              wound to avoid infection. She knew it wasn't, but it was all she
              had to help her little Rian.<br /><br />
              "Hold on, Rian, I'm with you," Maeve whispered lovingly, as she
              held him gently and squeezed his hand. Her eyes filled with tears,
              but she forced herself to be strong. She was his sister, his
              protector, and at this moment she was the only one who could help
              him. With all her strength, she hoisted Rian onto the small bed
              and pulled the thin sheet over him. He couldn't get a fever now,
              that was important. Rian was so exhausted by now that his eyes
              were closing.
              <br /><br />
              Maeve sat quietly in the dark corner of the room, her hands firmly
              in her lap. The pain in her heart was unbearable. She knew Rian
              desperately needed a doctor, but she didn't have the money. Even
              though she was now receiving a higher salary from Desmond, she
              hadn't been able to save up because she still had to pay off her
              mother's funeral debt. Desperately, she wondered how she could get
              the money. <br />
              Gradually, a dark thought came to her. Upstairs in O'Brian's
              Restaurant, there were private rooms, where women were intimate
              with men for money. Maeve knew that this too was illegal and that
              the bar therefore had a secret spiral staircase that women could
              use to sneak out of the bar, backwards, if there was a raid. She
              also knew how reprehensible this kind of work was and that she
              never wanted to do it herself. Her upbringing, her religion, all
              of it told her that prostitution was a sin, a shame she was never
              allowed to commit, and that it weighed like a curse on the women
              of this trade forever. <br />
              But her heart beat for her brother. She loved him more than
              anything. She wanted to do everything to help him, even if it
              meant going against her convictions. She thought of his small,
              innocent eyes, of his pain, of the fear he carried in his gaze.
              She had already lost her mother; she couldn't lose her brother
              too! Life couldn't be that cruel. Rian was all she had left.
              Without him, she wouldn't be able to live either, in a country
              that was so foreign to her.<br />
              "And if I do?" she asked herself, filled with self-doubt. "I'm
              just a simple immigrant, what else can I expect from life? I just
              want Rian to get well again. I would do anything to save him."
              <br /><br />
              At the same time, she felt disgust and revulsion at the thought of
              offering herself to men for money. She had been raised to believe
              that women should be pure and untouched, that they could only
              share their love in marriage. The thought of losing her dignity
              almost made her sick. But the love for her brother was stronger
              than anything. She knew she had no other choice if she wanted to
              save him. The inner battle raged within her. She could not betray
              her values, her convictions, her honor. And at the same time,
              there was the desperate sisterly love that surpassed everything.
              She was willing to risk everything, do anything, to save her
              brother's life.<br />
              With a trembling hand, Maeve closed her eyes, fighting back the
              tears, knowing she had to make a decision that night. Every hour
              could decide her brother's fate.<br />
              The next morning, her decision was made. Rian was still asleep,
              and so she didn't want to disturb him. She quietly crept out of
              the apartment. With a steady stride, she walked up 34th Street,
              crossed three more intersections until she stood in front of
              O'Brian's restaurant. <br /><br />
              The restaurant wasn't open yet, so she sat on the steps in front
              of the entrance and waited. Tears kept streaming down her cheeks.
              Then she heard a car drive into the backyard. That must be
              Desmond, she thought. With her bare hands, she wiped her face dry,
              stood up, and dusted herself off. Then she, too, went into the
              backyard to enter the restaurant with Desmond across the terrace.
              It was important to her to have the conversation with him as
              quickly as possible, before any other employee entered the
              restaurant.
              <br /><br />
              “At work so early?” Desmond asked, surprised.
              <br />"I couldn't sleep," Maeve tried to begin the difficult
              topic. Maeve trembled, her voice barely above a whisper as she
              asked cautiously, "Desmond... do you think I could... maybe work
              upstairs to earn more money?" <br /><br />
              "Upstairs? Maeve, what are you talking about?" He could hardly
              believe what this kind-hearted girl was asking him. The shock was
              written all over his face. He had known Maeve as an honest, pious
              woman, to whom decency and modesty seemed to be a high priority.
              He looked into her eyes, stunned. But in her eyes there was only
              despair, which overshadowed everything else.<br />
              "Maeve..." he began cautiously, his voice filled with concern.
              "Why do you ask such a thing? What happened?" <br />She lowered
              her gaze, her hands shaking. "My brother... he was run over by a
              horse-drawn carriage. His leg is badly injured, and I don't have
              the money to pay a doctor. I know what I'm asking is wrong... but
              I don't know what to do. I would do anything to help him. He's
              only ten years old. If he becomes crippled now... or even dies!
              He's the last person I have left." <br />
              Desmond looked at her silently for a moment, then took a deep
              breath. All of this was getting to him, too. <br /><br />
              "Maeve," he said quietly, "we'll find a solution. I promise you."
              He hesitated for a moment, then continued, "Look. I'll cover the
              medical expenses. And then you'll pay me back the costs later,
              step by step...let's say Rian could take on a few tasks for me.
              Simple things, courier services, or something like that. We'll
              come to an agreement then."
              <br /><br />
              There was something so comforting and hopeful in his voice. Maeve
              looked at him with wide, grateful eyes. Tears still lingered in
              her eyes, but she smiled hesitantly. "That... that I can't accept,
              that's too kind of you, Desmond. I don't know how I can ever thank
              you." <br />
              She showed her warmth and gratitude not only in words, but also in
              small gestures. Her quiet, sincere "Thank you" was accompanied by
              a brief glance that made Desmond feel all her trust. Then he felt
              her delicate fingers stroke the back of his hairy hand. "I will do
              whatever is necessary to save my brother," she whispered. "And I
              will always be grateful to you." <br /><br />
              Desmond returned her gaze with an understanding smile. He knew he
              couldn't abandon Maeve during this difficult time, and he was
              touched by the warmth this woman radiated.
              <br /><br />

            <h3>Chapter 5</h3>
            <p>
              Thanks to the good medical care, Rian gradually recovered. Desmond
              made sure to occasionally check in on Maeve and Rian to make sure
              everything was okay. He was always struck by how poorly the two
              lived in their small apartment. But Manhattan was expensive and
              living space was scarce. So Desmond made it a habit to always
              bring them a little something whenever he showed up in Hell's
              Kitchen. Sometimes a few flowers, sometimes some chocolate or
              comics for Rian.
              <br /><br />
              When Rian was well again, he told Maeves that they should both be
              at the restaurant around 10 a.m. on Thursday.<br />
              "I promised him you'd perform some services for him," Maeve
              explained to her brother Rian. "After all, he paid the expensive
              medical bills. Let's not think about how you'd be today without
              him." She looked lovingly down at Rian, who was sitting on the
              floor, pulling on his socks.
              <br /><br />
              "Maeve, don't worry, it's okay. Desmond is a great guy. I'm happy
              to help him. Let's go, otherwise we'll be late," Rian whined.
              <br /><br />
              They were just about to enter the restaurant when they heard a
              voice behind them. It was Desmond. They quickly turned around and
              saw Desmond waving to them from a sleek Bentley. "We're not going
              to the restaurant today, we're going to the seaside. Get in!" he
              called.
              <br /><br />
              The two had never sat in such a beautiful car. Everything seemed
              like a dream. They passed through the streets of Manhattan and,
              after a while, reached Coney Island. The sky shone with a warm,
              golden light as they arrived in front of the amusement park.
              <br /><br />

                alt=""
              /><br /><br />
              "Oh, an amusement park," Rian cheered. "We've never been to an
              amusement park before!" The boy was almost unstoppable. Everything
              inside him trembled with joy. They had barely entered the park
              when the colorful lights, the cheerful laughter of the people, and
              the sound of the ocean waves enveloped them as if by magic.
              <br /><br />
              Maeve felt a new vitality spreading within her. She had once been
              shy, but today she beamed with joy, her eyes sparkling with
              excitement. "Wow, look, Rian! This is amazing!" Maeve exclaimed,
              laughing, as she looked at the colorful stalls and rides.<br /><br />
              Rian jumped excitedly next to her. "I want to ride a roller
              coaster! Please, Maeve! Please!" Maeve smiled lovingly and let her
              gaze wander to Desmond.<br />
              "Sure, Rian. We'll do that!" he agreed, "but first let's get some
              cotton candy, okay?" They walked over to a small stand where a
              friendly saleswoman handed them a large bag of cotton candy. Maeve
              held it out to Rian, who immediately enthusiastically popped the
              sweet mass into his mouth. "Mmm, this is so delicious!" Rian said,
              beaming.<br />
              Maeve laughed. "It's so nice that you're happy again." She glanced
              gratefully at Desmond. <br />Shortly after, they were standing in
              front of the roller coaster. Maeve hesitated for a moment, but
              Desmond took her arm and said mischievously, "My lady, you're not
              going to turn me down, are you?"<br />
              Maeve giggled, then looked into Rian's shining eyes and felt her
              fear vanish. She put her concerns aside and said, "Okay, let's go
              for it. Together!"<br />
              Desmond, standing next to them, smiled charmingly. "I think this
              will be a lot of fun."<br />
              "Thanks, Desmond!" Maeve shouted, while Rian could barely stand
              still with excitement. They climbed into a car, and the ride
              began. Maeve screamed with joy as the roller coaster spun around
              rapid turns and loops. Rian yelled, and Desmond couldn't help but
              laugh out loud.<br />
              “This is so exciting!” Maeve exclaimed, leaning against
              Desmond.<br />
              "You're showing a whole different side of yourself today, Maeve. I
              really like that," he whispered in her ear as they enjoyed the
              ride.<br />
              After the roller coaster, they sat down on a park bench to rest.
              Desmond got a bag of popcorn from a small stand and handed Rian a
              handful. "Here, Rian. This is for you."<br />
              “Thanks, Desmond!” said Rian, nibbling happily.
              <br />"Would you like something sweet?" Desmond asked, turning to
              Maeve.<br />
              “I'll have a lemonade, please,” she replied.<br />
              "And what do you think about trying out the swing boat? It's
              really nice too," Rian called out.<br /><br />
              "Sounds perfect!" Maeve beamed. "I love being here with you." They
              continued strolling through the park, laughing, telling stories,
              and taking photos.<br />
              As Rian climbed the giant slide alone, Maeve plucked up the
              courage to tell Desmond how she had ended up in Hell's Kitchen.
              She told him about her mother, Darcy, who had married her father,
              Patrick Gallagher, in 1902. Back then, she was a real daddy's
              girl, Maeve admitted. She would have loved to marry him herself,
              this tall, powerful man who could fix anything that was broken in
              the house, and who was also tender and sensitive. They, too, had
              taken wonderful trips back then. Not expensive ones, just simple
              excursions into nature. Especially to the sea. They had gone
              fishing there, and in the evenings, when her parents were sitting
              close together around the campfire, she would sit next to them and
              practice Irish folk songs on her little guitar. Despite all the
              poverty that prevailed in Ireland, they had been a happy family.
              <br /><br />
              In addition, her father worked at Harland & Wolff, one of
              Ireland's largest shipyards, so at least a modest income was
              secured. All in all, she had a happy childhood, until, yes, until
              her father died in an accident at work. This put the family in
              real distress. Her mother's salary as a seamstress was barely
              enough to support themselves, and so her mother decided that,
              following her sister Mary's decision, they should emigrate to the
              USA.
              <br /><br />
              Heavily pregnant, Darcy boarded the emigrant ship in Belfast with
              her, Maeve, and it was fortunate that she hadn't gone into labor
              until she was in Manhattan. Courageous fellow countrymen ensured
              that they found shelter in Hell's Kitchen before Rian even saw the
              light of day. The little family's joy at their successful new
              beginning didn't last long, however, because, scarred by all the
              strains and without medical care, her mother recovered very slowly
              from the birth. Her 10-hour shifts as a seamstress in a textile
              factory drained her last strength, and she died last year.
              <br /><br />
              Maeve had to hold on to Desmond as the images of the cemetery came
              back to her. Tears streamed down her cheeks. <br />
              Desmond felt her pain. He gently hugged her and calmed her.
              <br /><br />
              <img
                style="border-radius: 50%"

                alt=""
              /><br /><br />
              Then he told her about himself, because everything Maeve had told
              him had made him quite nervous. "Hard to believe," he began, "I
              know the Harland & Wolff shipyard, too. You know, I grew up in an
              orphanage in Belfast. It wasn't nice there at all. They totally
              neglected us, and we were constantly being beaten. I left when I
              was 16. At first, I worked at Harland & Wolff, but only briefly.
              Then I started working for an electrician and stayed there for
              almost nine years. It was actually a nice time. But I always saw
              the emigrant ships, and then I wanted to leave too.
              <br /><br />
              I had no one in Ireland. So I boarded a ship to seek my fortune in
              America. That was less than two years ago. When I arrived here,
              Prohibition began. That's when I saw the opportunity for myself
              and turned it into my business and now look at me. I have several
              bars in the Tenderloin, a fancy car, networks reaching into the
              upper echelons of society and once I marry my fiancée, I'll be one
              of them too. Maeve, then I've made it," he beamed like a Cheshire
              cat.
              <br /><br />
              Maeve smiled at him. Desmond encouraged her, "And you, Maeve,
              you'll make it too. Take control of your life. Don't do it like
              all the other immigrants. Find your own way up." He lovingly
              nudged her side with his hand.
              <br /><br />
              Then Rian came back from the slide, panting. "You have no idea how
              many times I climbed up. Man, that was beautiful."
              <br /><br />
              They treated themselves to another orange juice and then continued
              their walk through the park. The sun slowly began to set, bathing
              the sky in warm orange and pink. The lights in the park grew
              brighter, and the atmosphere even more magical.<br />
              "Do you want to take another ride on the Ferris wheel?" asked
              Maeve. "Everything looks so beautiful from above."<br />
              "Yeah, that sounds great!" Rian exclaimed enthusiastically. "I
              want to see the whole city from above!"<br />
              They pushed through the crowd and reached the whitewashed Ferris
              wheel. Maeve felt her excitement growing. Together they climbed
              into the basket, which slowly rose into the air. The world below
              them grew smaller and smaller as they enjoyed the view of the
              sparkling park, the sea, and the sky.
              <br /><br />
              “Look how beautiful this all is!” said Desmond as they admired the
              view.<br />
              "I never thought I'd feel so free and happy," Maeve whispered.<br />
              "You've shown so much courage today, Maeve," Desmond said gently.
              "I'm glad to see you so happy."<br />
              Rian, who was sitting next to them, pointed out to the sea. "Look
              over there! The water sparkles like diamonds." <br />Maeve smiled
              and felt her heart leap with happiness. "Thank you for spending
              this day with me. It means a lot to me." <br /><br />
              The basket rocked gently in the breeze as they caught the last
              rays of sunlight. Maeve felt her worries and fears of everyday
              life vanish for a moment. She was grateful for these special
              moments, for the feeling of being alive again.<br />
              As the Ferris wheel slowly descended, Maeve was filled with hope
              and confidence. She knew this day was a turning point, a day she
              had rediscovered herself.
              <br /><br />
              They left the park together, hand in hand, full of hope for what
              was to come.
              <br /><br />
              "That was the best day of my life," Maeve said quietly, as she
              looked at Desmond. "Thank you for this wonderful invitation."<br />
              "Thank you, Mr. O'Brian," Rian shook Desmond's hand with a beaming
              smile. Then they drove back to the city.

              <br /><br />

            <h3>Chapter 6</h3>
            <p>
              That day, the sky hung heavy and overcast over Manhattan. Wearing
              a worn cap, Rian crept through the narrow streets. Desmond had
              explained to him what he was supposed to do. Disguised as a
              paperboy, he was supposed to visit certain bars and pubs and
              deliver doctored newspapers.<br />
              Even though the Tenderloin and Hell's Kitchen had many dark
              corners, where shady characters lurked, Rian wasn't afraid,
              because he was born and raised here. This America was his home. He
              also knew what he was doing his service for. For his friend
              Desmond. Not only did he probably owe his life to Desmond, but
              Desmond was also his great role model. Rian wanted to be like
              Desmond one day.
              <br /><br />
              He pulled the old cap Desmond had lent him lower over his face. In
              his small hand, he held a stack of sealed letters that he was
              supposed to distribute to the bars and eateries nearby. The
              letters were always carefully sealed, sealed, and bore a small
              number that Rian could use to assign each letter to a bar.<br /><br />
              "Okay, Rian," he muttered quietly to himself as he headed for the
              first bar. "Here's the first one." <br /><br />
              He pushed open the creaking door and stepped into a dark, smoky
              bar. The smell of alcohol, cigarette smoke, and old wooden planks
              hung heavy in the air. A man with a black mustache sat at the bar,
              eyeing him suspiciously.
              <br /><br />
              "Good evening, young man," said the bartender in a raspy voice.
              "What do you have there?" <br />Rian cleared his throat and slid a
              newspaper across the counter. He had previously placed the letter
              in the middle section. "The Daily News, or don't you want a
              newspaper?" <br /><br />
              The bartender took the newspaper and nodded. "Everything's fine.
              Thanks, boy." Rian turned around and left the bar. Now he felt a
              bit like he was on a secret mission. On his way to "The Blind
              Pig," he walked through dimly lit streets. Inside the inn, a
              red-haired woman greeted him. "Well, you little messenger. What's
              up this time?" <br /><br />
              "I wonder if it's today's edition of the Daily News," said Rian,
              handing her the newspaper and envelope.<br />"Thanks, sweetie,"
              she said, feeling the letter and checking the seal. "Everything's
              as usual."<br />
              As he continued walking, Rian felt a mixture of curiosity and
              uncertainty. He didn't know exactly what the letters said, only
              that they were important to the bars. Desmond had forbidden him to
              break the seals, and he was well-bred to know how important it was
              to keep promises. In another bar, The Gilded Lily, an older man
              with thinning hair approached him. "Here, boy. This is for you."
              <br /><br />
              Rian took the thick cookie and greedily shoved it into his mouth.
              The room was filled with the quiet murmurs of the guests, the
              clinking of glasses, and the rustling of magazines. <br /><br />
              "Thanks," he said shyly. "I just had to drop something off." and
              handed over the newspaper. It was the last letter Rian had to
              deliver today. Otherwise, he only had a few newspapers left in his
              hand. <br /><br />
              The man nodded. "Keep it up, kid. This is important."<br />
              But suddenly, the serene atmosphere was interrupted by muffled
              noises, banging, and shouts. The door was flung open, and police
              officers stormed into the bar. In an instant, they were buzzing
              around the entire room. <br />“Everyone on the floor!” shouted an
              officer, as he forcefully pushed the guests aside.<br />
              The music stopped, and the guests held their breath. Rian looked
              at the landlord in horror. Amidst the chaos, a police officer
              noticed Rian hastily hiding in a corner. He was still wearing his
              cap and a worn jacket that barely concealed his petite frame. In
              his hand, he held a small bag full of magazines. <br /><br />
              "Hey, boy, what do we have here?" a police officer approached him
              questioningly. He searched the bag containing the magazines but
              found nothing suspicious. <br /><br />
              "What are you doing here, kid?" the policeman asked him, his voice
              sharp and impatient.<br />
              Rian trembled, but he looked up bravely. "I work for the
              newspaper. I distribute the Daily News throughout the area." His
              voice was quiet but firm. <br /><br />
              The policeman snorted. "Of course, another one of those naughty
              little fellows. And where are your parents?" he asked, his eyes
              twinkling suspiciously. <br /><br />
              Rian took a deep breath. "They're both dead. I live with my sister
              now." His voice trailed off. <br /><br />
              The police officers looked at each other. They were in a bad mood
              because their raid hadn't produced the desired results. There were
              no alcoholic beverages to be found in the inn.<br />
              If they couldn't get this Irish rabble for Prohibition, there had
              to be another reason to read them the riot act, they thought. Then
              they looked down on Rian. <br />"A little boy lives with his
              little sister. How touching. Let's just take them both to the
              orphanage." <br />Rian shook his head vigorously. "My sister Maeve
              is already 17 years old. She takes care of me. She's strong and
              goes to work." His small hands clenched into fists. "So she's
              almost grown up." <br /><br />
              But the police officers were adamant. "This isn't your decision,
              boy. We make it." They grabbed him carefully but firmly, while
              Rian desperately tried to free himself. <br />The innkeeper, who
              had been watching everything, rushed forward. "Please, leave him
              alone! He's just a child like any other around here. There are
              plenty of minors in the Tenderloin, you know that. Why does he
              have to go to an orphanage now?"<br />
              The senior officer looked at him, his expression hard. "His sister
              is only seventeen. That's not enough. We have to follow the law."
              <br /><br />
              In his distress, the proprietor sent a friend to O'Brain's
              Restaurant to tell Desmond about the incident. He only found
              Maeve, who couldn't believe what he had confided in her. <br />She
              stood on the terrace, her hands soaking wet with sweat. The sky
              was gray, but in her heart burned a force stronger than ever
              before. Rian was gone, in an orphanage, and she knew she had to
              get him out of there. Rian, my God, Rian," she thought.<br />
              When Desmond finally appeared at the restaurant, she ran toward
              him, pale as a sheet. "Desmond," Maeve began, her voice barely
              above a whisper, "I need to talk to you. It's about Rian."
              <br /><br />
              Desmond looked up, his brown eyes full of compassion. "Maeve, I
              know what happened. I spoke to the police."<br />
              “And what did they say?” Her eyes searched desperately for an
              answer.<br />
              "I explained to them that I'm going to adopt Rian. I signed a
              statement that I'll take care of him." He stood up, walked toward
              her, and placed a hand on her shoulder. "I'll do everything I can
              to keep him safe."<br />
              Maeve shook her head, tears welling up in her eyes. She could
              hardly believe what he was willing to do for her.
              <br /><br />
              "Why are you doing this for us? You have your own life. You're
              getting married soon. Does your fiancée know about it yet?"<br />
              Desmond smiled warmly, his voice calm and determined. "Because I
              know what it's like to grow up in an orphanage. I grew up there
              myself. I was abused, neglected, but I managed to break free. And
              I will make sure Rian doesn't have to go through that."
              <br />"You're so good," Maeve whispered, her voice full of
              gratitude. "You're like a rock." <br /><br />
              "It's true that I'm getting married to my fiancée soon," he added.
              "We can always figure out how to arrange everything then. I think
              we'll just leave it as it is. He'll stay with you, and if the
              police think they need to check, he'll just come and stay with us
              for a few days. It's that simple."
              <br /><br />
              Maeve nodded, tears streaming down her cheeks. "Thank you,
              Desmond. Truly, I'm so grateful." <br />He hugged her. "Maeve,
              it'll be okay. Rian will be back with you soon." Maeve felt a wave
              of relief and hope. <br /><br />
              By late afternoon, the news came that the authorities would be
              releasing Rian. When Maeve finally saw him again, she ran to him,
              her arms protectively around him. "Rian, my little one," she
              whispered, tears of joy in her eyes. "You're back with me. I was
              so scared for you."<br /><br />
              The little boy looked at her with big, grateful eyes. "Maeve,
              together we are unbeatable. And now I'm back with you, so there's
              no reason to cry anymore."<br />
              Maeve knelt down, took him in her arms, and whispered, "Yes, Rian.
              Together we are invincible." Finally, composure returned to her.
            </p>

            <h3>Chapter 7:</h3>
            <p>
              The new day seemed to be a perfectly normal workday. The
              restaurant was filled with dim lighting, soft jazz music drifted
              through the air, and the tables were nicely set. Only one person
              was missing. Maeve looked at her watch. "At this time, Joe should
              already be behind the bar, making preparations for the evening. Do
              you have any idea where he might be?" she turned to Patricia.
              <br /><br />
              "No, he didn't say anything. What will we do if he doesn't come?"
              Patricia became nervous.<br />
              Maeve began drumming her fingers on the counter and grinning
              broadly. "Oh, Patricia, don't worry. Joe explained the basic
              recipes to me. Why don't we just get a little creative? I mean,
              we're here to lighten the mood, right?"<br />
              Patricia shook her head. "So you just want to start mixing? That
              could go terribly wrong. What if we mix the wrong ingredients and
              the cocktails don't taste good at all?"<br />
              Maeve winked mischievously. "Oh, Patricia, life's too short for
              boring drinks! Besides, what could possibly happen? If it goes
              wrong, we'll just make a funny story out of it. And who knows,
              maybe this will be the hit of the evening!"
              <br /><br />
              Patricia looked at Maeve skeptically, but then she grinned
              reluctantly. "Okay, but only because you're so enthusiastic.
              You'll only mix simple things, okay? No complicated specialty
              drinks à la Joe, promise me." <br /><br />
              Maeve winked at her. "Got it! Simple, but brilliant. Let's go!"
              She grabbed a bottle of gin that she happened to find and poured
              generously into a glass. Then she grabbed a can of tonic water
              that was next to the glass and filled it up. "Here, Patricia, try
              this!" <br /><br />
              Patricia picked up the glass, sniffed cautiously, and took a quick
              sip. "Hmm, that's... okay. But what kind of cocktail is that?"
              Maeve grinned broadly. "It's my own creation: the Maeve Tonic!
              Simple, refreshing, and perfect for a start."
              <br /><br />
              At that moment, the door opened, and Joe entered, his hands in his
              pockets, a mischievous grin on his lips. "So, what's going on
              here? I can already smell the scent of chaos." <br />Maeve, who
              was just starting another attempt, quickly grabbed a bottle of
              vodka.<br />
              "Joe! We have a bit of an emergency here, and Maeve has decided to
              take over the bar," Patricia explained. "I'm calling it... Maeve's
              Experiment!" <br /><br />
              Joe grinned and looked at the scene. "Well, that sounds promising.
              What are you planning?"<br />
              Maeve poured a shot of rum into the glass and cheerfully replied:
              "I'm trying a cocktail I call 'Sunshine.' It's a mix of everything
              we have. And I'm telling you, it's going to be fantastic!"
              <br /><br />
              She threw a handful of ice into the glass, stirred furiously, and
              then proudly presented the result. "Here, taste!" With that, she
              pushed the glass toward Joe. <br /><br />
              Joe sniffed a bit, then looked at the colorful mixture more
              closely and grinned mischievously. "Well, Maeve, that looks like
              storm damage at the painter's. But who knows, maybe that's the
              next big thing." He took a small sip, grimaced, and said with a
              laugh, "Hmm, that's... interesting. But we'd better not serve that
              to anyone."<br /><br />
              "Here, the first guests are coming," Joe pointed to the door
              through which a group of men was now pushing, "we'd better all get
              back to the positions we know best." He winked at Maeve, who, with
              a wink, agreed and, together with Patricia, welcomed the guests.
              <br /><br />
              She had a lot of fun that day.
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            <h3>Kapitel 8:</h3>
            <p>
              The next day, Maeve was setting the tables in the restaurant when
              the door abruptly burst open. A man, tall and broad, with a scowl
              and a smarmy grin, entered. It was clear he was no friend of the
              establishment.
              <br /><br />
              "Well, little girl," he said in a raspy voice, "we're here to
              collect protection money." His eyes flashed menacingly.
              <br />Maeve felt her heart beating faster, but she remained calm.
              She knew she was in a dangerous situation, but she wasn't about to
              give up without a fight. "I won't be bullied," Maeve said firmly,
              "and I won't pay any protection money." She raised her head,
              showing courage and determination. "If you want to cause trouble,
              please do it somewhere else."<br /><br />
              The man laughed crookedly. "You have no idea who you're talking
              to, kid. We won't let you just let us get away with it."<br />
              Maeve took a deep breath, gathered all her courage, and said,
              "Listen. We're about to open, and one of our first guests is
              Officer McLean. I'd be happy to introduce you, then you can
              address your request directly to him."
              <br /><br />
              The man seemed to hesitate briefly, his eyes still blazing with
              anger. But Maeve seized the opportunity: "If you don't want to end
              up in jail today, you'd better leave now. I'm not joking."
              <br /><br />
              She stood firm, her voice clear and determined. The man looked at
              her for a moment, seemed to think, and finally snorted
              contemptuously. "All right, little girl. We'll be back. But
              remember, next time we come, it will be different." With one last
              angry look, he turned and disappeared through the door. Maeve
              breathed a sigh of relief.
              <br /><br />
              Desmond didn't show up at the restaurant until late that evening.
              Maeve immediately ran to him and told him what had happened.
              "Desmond, something happened, something bad," Maeve began
              hesitantly. "A mafia guy came in and wanted to extort protection
              money. I told him we'd be opening soon and that Officer McLean had
              already called, so they could tell him what they were doing. The
              guy then took off, but threatened that he'd come back."<br />
              Desmond listened attentively, his eyes now strained. When Maeve
              finished, he placed a hand on her shoulder and said, touched,
              "Maeve, you did everything right. You acted courageously and
              wisely. You're really committed to the restaurant and to me, I
              appreciate that. I need to think about what to do." With that, he
              retreated to his office, his expression dark. <br /><br />
              After the last guest had left, Maeve also set off for home. Even
              though the Tenderloin and Hell's Kitchen weren't far apart, the
              walk seemed endless today. The streets seemed even darker, even
              more dangerous than usual. Maeve thought she saw criminal figures
              everywhere and feared that the mob boss was already lurking around
              the next corner, ready to take revenge. <br /><br />
              She was relieved when she was finally able to lock the apartment
              door behind her. She quietly crept to the sink. Rian was already
              fast asleep in bed. She washed the sweat from her face and then
              snuggled up to Rian and fell asleep.
              <br /><br />
              But the night wouldn't last long, because just a few hours later,
              there was a loud knock at the door. Maeve was startled. That had
              to be him, the mafia guy who had threatened her in the restaurant.
              Rian was also roused from his sleep. There was still a knock at
              the door. Rian, who didn't share his sister's fears, jumped up to
              look, but Maeve pulled him back. "Don't open the door, Rian, who
              knows who's out there." <br /><br />
              “Who's there?” Rian called out nonchalantly.<br />
              “It's me, please let me in, quickly,” you heard a voice.
              <br /><br />
              Now Maeve jumped up too, because she recognized the voice. It was
              Desmond. When she opened the door, Desmond fell into her arms. He
              was bleeding heavily and could barely stand up. Together with
              Rian, she pulled Desmond into her apartment and closed the door.
              <br /><br />
              "For God's sake, what happened?" she demanded. At the same time,
              she instructed Rian to boil water and bring a cloth and vinegar so
              she could dress Desmond's wound. They had to cut open his trouser
              leg with scissors because blood was still gushing from his left
              thigh. When the wound was exposed, Maeve realized that a cartridge
              was lodged in the flesh. "The cartridge must be removed, or the
              wound will become infected. We need to get a doctor immediately,"
              Maeve stated.
              <br /><br />
              Desmond grabbed her arm. "No doctor, you hear, no doctor!"
              <br />"Okay, whatever you want," Maeve was understanding, "but the
              cartridge has to come out. There's no way around it. Rian, bring
              the wooden spoon and push it between Desmond's teeth. I'm going to
              remove the cartridge now with the kitchen knife. I'll try to be as
              careful as possible, but it's going to hurt, Desmond," she closed
              her eyes and breathed heavily. But she knew she had to be strong
              now. <br /><br />
              While Rian held Desmond, Maeve carefully stabbed the wound,
              twisted the knife so she could slide it under the cartridge, and
              then pulled it out with a jerk. She quickly pressed the cloth
              soaked in vinegar onto the wound to stop the bleeding. Then she
              reached into her sewing kit and sewed the wound closed with three
              stitches. "The worst is behind you now," she stroked his face.
              "What happened? Who shot you?" Her eyes were full of concern.
              <br /><br />
              Desmond had put the wooden spoon aside again. He took a deep
              breath and leaned forward against Maeve. "Later, Maeve, I need to
              rest now." <br />To avoid putting further pressure on the wound,
              they let Desmond sleep on the floor, but placed a wool blanket
              under his body to make it softer. Then they, too, went back to
              sleep. <br /><br />
              The next morning, Desmond told them in detail what had happened
              that night. The Five Points liquor mafia had tried to advance into
              the Tenderloin. Desmond assumed that the guy who was trying to
              extort protection money from Maeve in the restaurant was part of
              this gang. A fight had broken out between the gang Desmond
              belonged to and the Five Points gang, which ended in a gunfight on
              32nd Street. He had been shot in the thigh and was barely able to
              escape. Behind him, he had already heard the police sirens
              approaching 32nd Street. <br /><br />
              It would be better if he didn't go to the office today, he
              decided. "But Maeve, you should check on things at the restaurant,
              that would be very important to me," he pleaded with Maeve.
              <br /><br />
              "You can stay here as long as you like. Rian is here too and will
              take care of you. I'll unlock the restaurant right away so
              everyone can see that business is continuing." She blew Desmond a
              kiss and left the apartment.
              <br /><br />
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            <h3>Chapter 9:</h3>
            <p>
              Maeve opened the restaurant's heavy door. The dim light of the gas
              lamps cast flickering shadows on the walls as she polished the
              glasses and the first guests took their seats. Suddenly, two
              police officers entered, their hats pulled low over their faces,
              their expressions serious. One of the men said in a raspy voice,
              "We need to speak to Desmond O'Brian." Maeve approached the police
              officers, "He's not here."
              <br /><br />
              "Then we need to talk to you. It's about a shooting last night in
              which someone was killed." Maeve felt her heart beat faster.<br />
              "What? Who? Where? When was that?" she asked, her voice trembling
              slightly. <br /><br />
              "On 32nd Street, around 1 a.m. Desmond O'Brian's wallet was found
              at the crime scene. He is now a murder suspect." <br /><br />
              Maeve tried to stay calm. "That can't be happening. Desmond was
              with me all night." She took a deep breath. "I'm his lover. He was
              in my bed all night."<br />
              The police officers looked at each other, visibly confused. "So
              you're claiming he was with you? That's interesting. Do you have
              any other evidence?" "Of course," Maeve said quickly. "He was with
              me, and my son Rian was also in the apartment. So we're two
              witnesses." <br /><br />
              "Witnesses?" The police officer raised an eyebrow. "And what about
              the wallet? We found it near the crime scene," he held a light
              brown folder under her nose.
              <br /><br />
              "Desmond's been missing her for a while," Maeve admitted. "Maybe
              he lost her there because he also runs a bar there, on the corner
              of 33rd and 32nd Streets."<br />
              The fatter policeman snorted angrily. "That would be too good to
              believe. It looks like her lover is in serious trouble. But if he
              has two witnesses."<br />
              They looked at Maeve, and the shorter police officer said in a
              mocking tone: "Aha, so he's your lover. You're probably also
              active in the red-light district. Then we'll summon you right
              away. To the medical examiner. He should take a closer look at
              you, also because of the illnesses that are not so common among
              prostitutes. We'll follow up on what the medical examiner finds
              out."<br />
              Maeve felt her breathing become more difficult. The police
              officers' words echoed in her head as the two left the bar and the
              door closed behind them. <br /><br />
              Maeve threw her hands up in the air. Only slowly did she realize
              what she had done. Out of love for Desmond, she had given him a
              false alibi, and now she herself was trapped. She was just a
              simple waitress, but the police seemed to think she was a hooker
              who was about to be sent to the health department. Dejected, Maeve
              started for home. A cold shiver ran down her spine. In the shadows
              of the night, she stood there, feeling caught in a web of love,
              betrayal, and danger.
              <br /><br />
              At home, she told Rian and Desmond about the incident with the
              police. Desmond seemed relieved and thanked Maeve several times.
              It was a great help that he now had a solid alibi. Now that he was
              no longer in danger, he urgently needed to get back to his bar.
              After all, he was marrying his fiancée in two days, and there was
              still a lot to prepare. In no time, he had left Maeve's apartment.
              <br /><br />
              Maeve lay awake in her bed all night, staring at the ceiling.
              Sleep was out of her mind. The night was filled with brooding and
              doubt, hanging over her like dark shadows. For hours, she
              struggled with what to do. Her faith, her honor, her love,
              everything seemed to be in an irreconcilable conflict.
              <br /><br />
              She had done everything she could to save Desmond. She had given
              the police a false alibi just to save Desmond from the
              executioner, because murder was still punishable by death. But
              now, as the moment of truth approached, she feared that her alibi
              might fall apart. The doctor at the health department would
              examine her and determine that she couldn't possibly have slept
              with Desmond.
              <br /><br />
              If the doctor were to notice her innocence, her alibi as a lover
              would be worthless. Then Desmond's life would be in danger again,
              and she herself would also face a hefty fine for perjury. As an
              Irish immigrant, she wouldn't have much to expect in the US with a
              criminal record. She knew that everything was at stake, especially
              her honor and her soul.<br /><br />
              She was torn. She loved Desmond, she knew that deep in her heart.
              But she also knew that in two days he would be marrying his
              fiancée. She had to make sure the alibi held, but how would that
              work? Should she go to Desmond and explain everything and give
              herself to him? But if he married someone else, then she would
              just be a pawn, and she didn't want to be treated as one. Nor
              would such behavior be compatible with her religious beliefs.
              <br /><br />
              After not sleeping a wink all night, Maeve sneaked out of the
              house early in the morning. The mailman had tacked an envelope to
              the door. Maeve picked it up, turned it over, and realized it was
              from her aunt. Still lost in thought, she paid no further
              attention to the letter and simply slipped it into her jacket
              pocket. Then she walked slowly through the dark streets toward the
              restaurant. Her heart felt like lead.
              <br /><br />
              She knew she would be with Desmond soon, but her head was still
              full of doubts and fears, hanging like dark clouds inside her. Her
              mind cried out for love, for closeness, for comfort, but her
              faith, her honor, and the fear of what might come held her back.
              She loved Desmond, she felt it deep in her soul. His eyes, his
              laughter, the warmth of his closeness, all of it drew her in like
              a magic wand. At the same time, however, she knew that in this
              moment she had to make a decision that would change her life
              forever.
              <br /><br />
              She stepped onto the restaurant's terrace. At this time of night,
              the restaurant was still closed. So she sat down on a patio chair.
              Seeking relaxation, she let her hand slide down her body. Her
              fingers felt the letter in her jacket. Slowly, she pulled it out
              of her jacket pocket and opened it. She began to read. Line by
              line, her eyes slid over the words her aunt had written.
              <br /><br />
              <em
                >My dear Maeve, <br /><br />
                I haven't heard from you in a long time, dear.
                <br /><br />
                The last time you wrote to me, it was from the funeral of your
                mother, my half-sister Darcy. It broke my heart to read your
                lines. Darcy was always such a courageous, God-fearing woman.
                She was never afraid to take on the risks that life presented
                her with, because she knew that she could rely on God and
                herself. Emigrating as a heavily pregnant widow is not something
                everyone dares to do. She, too, had realized that she had to
                take her life into her own hands.
                <br /><br />
                Another potato blight year in a row that ruined the entire
                harvest, and you would have starved to death in Belfast. Believe
                me, she basically did everything right.
                <br /><br />
                We were also devastated when we lost three of our children here
                to cholera. Since then, we've been collecting brushwood on the
                weekends so we can boil water before consumption. We still don't
                own much, but your uncle found a job in a construction company,
                and I help out on a farm. Our daughter Louisa is our pride and
                joy. She's 16 and is allowed to work as a maid. And Gregg, who
                also works on a farm, wants to join the US military when he's
                18. You see, we're in the process of fully integrating here.
                <br /><br />
                How are you? How is your brother Rian?
                <br /><br />
                Drop us a line so we know you're okay and we don't have to
                worry. You know, if you're in need, you can always come to us.
                We don't have much, but we are and will always be a family,
                aren't we, Maeve? Trust in God, too, and remain reverent and
                humble.
                <br /><br />
                With love, Your Aunt Mary.</em
              ><br /><br />
              Determined, Maeve clutched the letter to her chest. She knew that
              Aunt Mary was right in her words. Her mother was indeed a brave
              woman who had taken her life into her own hands. And she would do
              the same now, Maeve vowed.
              <br /><br />
            </p>
            <h3>Chapter 10:</h3>
            <p>
              When she returned to her apartment, Rian was preparing breakfast.
              "The eggs are almost ready, Maeve," Rian grinned at her as he
              fiddled with the pan at the stove.
              <br /><br />
              "They're all yours today," Maeve told him, as she searched in her
              bag for the address of the doctor's office. Then her tone changed.
              She turned to Rian and said, almost in a commanding tone. "When
              you're done, clean up and pack everything up. Listen, pack
              everything in our two suitcases: the clothes, the shoes, the
              pictures, the last meal, pack everything up." I'll be right back,
              it won't be long, and she ran out of the house.
              <br /><br />
              She didn't have to wait long at the medical examiner's office.
              Since it was still early in the morning, she was called in after a
              few minutes. "Ah, the first patient, and such a handsome one,"
              greeted her, the medical examiner, an older man with graying
              temples. "How can I help you?" he began the examination.
              <br /><br />
              "I was sent here for an examination," her voice was quiet.<br />
              “Yes, that’s why all my patients come, but why are you coming?”
              the doctor wanted to know.<br />
              Maeve thought of Aunt Mary's letter. Of the courage, the
              determination that Mary had so admired in her mother. In Maeve's
              eyes, Mary had been no less brave. Then she remembered what Mary
              had written about her cousin Gregg. He's joining the military.
              Maeve looked up. Then she replied fervently, "I need your
              confirmation that I'm fit enough to join the military."
              <br /><br />
              “For the military,” the medical officer’s voice sounded
              surprised.<br />
              But Maeve repeated her statement with even more confidence.<br />
              “Ah, I see, you probably want to start working there as a
              secretary,” the doctor completed the thought.<br />
              Maeve took a deep breath. "Exactly, as a secretary." <br /><br />
              "Well, let's see what we can do," the doctor smiled. He began the
              examination and, after conducting a few measurements and tests,
              sat back down behind his massive desk. There, he wrote a few lines
              on a piece of paper, stamped the document, and elegantly signed it
              with his name. Then he handed the document to Maeve.
              <br /><br />
              Maeve could hardly believe what the doctor had written. "Maeve
              Gallagher, 5 feet 5 inches tall, 58 kg, completely healthy, no
              signs of illness/venereal disease, cardiovascular system in good
              working order, normal pulse, fully fit for work." She shook the
              doctor's hand gratefully before handing the document over to the
              station, as instructed by the police, and hurried back to Rian.
              <br /><br />
              Meanwhile, he had cleared the table, washed the dishes, put the
              two suitcases on the bed, and filled them with what little they
              owned. Maeve stormed into the apartment, straight toward him and
              boldly embraced him. "Rian, it's all solved. Now everything will
              be fine. We'll take our suitcases and leave this miserable Hell's
              Kitchen forever. Do you hear?" She kissed him on the forehead.
              Rian beamed. Finally, Maeve was happy again.
              <br /><br />
              They looked around their small apartment one last time to make
              sure they hadn't forgotten anything. They overlooked the letter
              from their aunt, which had fallen from the bed to the floor.
              Carrying their suitcases, they hurried to the train station, where
              they boarded the next train to Worcester.
              <br /><br />
              About four and a half hours later, they were standing at Worcester
              train station, Rian's hand firmly in Maeve's. The sun shone warmly
              on the old brick buildings, and the scent of coal and fresh coffee
              hung in the air. Rian, looking around curiously, tugged on her
              sleeve.<br /><br />
              “Maeve, where is Aunt Mary?” he whispered excitedly.
              <br />Maeve took a deep breath. They hadn't seen each other in
              years, since the time in Belfast when her aunt had migrated to the
              USA. "She doesn't know we're coming yet," she smiled at Rian.
              "This is supposed to be a surprise."<br /><br />
              After a lady with a dog gave them directions, they reached the
              house, on whose door her uncle's name was written in bold letters.
              With a trembling hand, Maeve knocked on the door. The door opened
              slowly, and Maeve froze. There she stood, the twin sister of their
              late mother, the aunt they had missed so much. Her eyes widened in
              surprise, and tears welled up in Maeve's eyes.<br /><br />
              "Maeve..." whispered the aunt, her voice warm and full of love.
              She took a step forward, opened her arms, and Maeve ran into her
              embrace, her tears unstoppable.<br />
              "We don't want to be a burden," Maeve said quietly as she pulled
              away. "Is there perhaps a vacant apartment in town we could move
              into?"<br /><br />
              "Your uncle is a construction worker, he'll definitely know where
              we can find a place for you." The aunt nodded understandingly.
              "Come in first. There'll be a solution."
              <br /><br />
              They drank coffee together and talked about everything that had
              happened over the past few months. Meanwhile, Maeve's uncle
              inquired about where the two could live and returned with an
              address.
              <br /><br />
              "It's not a big apartment, but it's clean and airy. Because you're
              still a minor, I had to vouch for the rent. Maeve, I signed for
              you, but we don't have the money to pay for another apartment.
              You'll have to work for it," he sounded a little worried, and his
              brow furrowed.
              <br /><br />
              Maeve thanked him wholeheartedly. "Uncle, I can work. I've always
              worked, please don't worry. We won't be a burden to you."
              <br /><br />
              Then she and Rian set off for their new home. Walking through the
              narrow streets, they passed Nick's Inn. Maeve stopped abruptly,
              her eyes flashing with curiosity.<br /><br />
              She pressed the apartment key into Rian's hand and said: "Rian,
              you're a big boy now, almost grown up, you hear. Anyone who can
              work for the mafia can also prove their independence here. It's
              only two blocks to our new apartment. Here's the key. Move
              everything in and make us a nice home. I have something to do
              here. Then I'll come after you. I love you very, very much." With
              that, she kissed him on the forehead and turned to the inn.<br /><br />
              "I'll go in," she said, encouraging herself, and opened the door.
              The inn was warm and inviting. The scent of freshly baked bread
              filled the air. Maeve stepped up to the counter, where Nick, a
              sturdy man with a friendly face, was just setting down a cup of
              coffee. "Good afternoon," Maeve cautiously began the conversation.
              "I'm Maeve. There's a sign outside saying you're looking to sell
              the inn. Is that correct?"<br /><br />
              Nick looked at her in surprise. "Sell? Well, actually, the inn is
              doing quite well, but... I want to go back to Ireland. I miss my
              family, my wife, and my son. I actually wanted to bring them over.
              That was my intention when I came here a year ago, but that won't
              be possible anymore. Personal reasons, you understand?"<br /><br />
              Maeve felt her heart beat faster. "I'd like to take over the Inn,"
              she said boldly. "I think I can do it. In Manhattan, I learned
              everything you need to know to run a restaurant-bar. Only, I don't
              have the money yet. But I can work, I can pay it off. You said
              you're staying for another three months?"<br /><br />
              Nick nodded. "Yes, that's true. That's enough time for you to test
              whether you can manage here. The Inn is more of a cafe anyway due
              to Prohibition. We can sort out the finances later."
              <br />Maeve smiled determinedly. "Then I'll do it. I'll help here
              at the café as best I can." She felt confidence growing within
              her. She had come here to find a new home, and now she was on her
              way to creating it herself. <br /><br />

            <h3>Chapter 11:</h3>
            <p>
              Fairy lights and flowers had been strung in front of the registry
              office in the Tenderloin. The sun shone brightly on the square in
              front, where the final wedding preparations were gradually being
              completed. Desmond stood in his white suit and nervously looked at
              the door. Today he was to marry his fiancée, Dorothy. It was a big
              event, because Dorothy came from an upscale merchant family, and
              the wedding would finally bring him into the social circles he had
              always dreamed of. Dorothy was also beautiful. <br />But the
              minutes dragged on endlessly. The bride was visibly late. His
              thoughts circled incessantly. They were less concerned with the
              upcoming wedding than with Maeve, his kind-hearted waitress, who
              had provided him with a false alibi to save him from the
              executioner. She was also the one who had courageously stitched
              his wound, defended him against the mafia in the restaurant, and
              who was always kind, helpful, almost self-sacrificing. At Coney
              Island, he had enjoyed her presence so infinitely, absorbing her
              lightness and cheerfulness like a thirsty man. It was her heart
              that always beat for him. <br /><br />
              Desmond glanced at his watch again. "Why isn't she here yet?
              What's this, a bride who doesn't show up for her own wedding?" he
              whispered desperately, nervously tugging at his handkerchief.<br />
              When the decorated Rolls-Royce with his fiancée finally arrived,
              the door opened, and Dorothy stepped out in an elegant white
              wedding dress, Desmond suddenly realized that this was not the
              woman he would marry. <br /><br />
              He had been so focused on his advancement that he hadn't realized
              until now that he didn't love his fiancée deeply. She was wealthy
              and beautiful, and that had been enough for him. But now that he
              had met Maeve, his heart only beat for the Irish woman.
              <br /><br />
              With a few words, he apologized to the bride, left the festive
              wedding party, and hurried to his restaurant. There, he found only
              Patricia. Concerned, he asked her about Maeve.<br />
              “Maeve hasn't come in for two days,” Patricia said quietly.
              <br />Desmond didn't understand the world anymore. This behavior
              didn't fit Maeve, who was always so loyal and reliable. Without
              hesitation, he rushed to her apartment, but when he opened the
              door, he found it empty. All her clothes, her few belongings,
              everything was gone. <br /><br />
              He was about to leave the room when he happened to notice an
              envelope under the bed. With one hand, he reached under the bed
              and pulled out the paper. Then he hastily studied the letter. It
              was from Maeve's aunt, who offered that Maeve could always turn to
              her if she was in need.<br />
              When Desmond saw the address in Worcester, his heart began to beat
              faster. He had to look for her there. In an instant, he jumped
              into his car and drove off, his thoughts swirling again in his
              head, but now he could feel his heart beating loudly.<br />
              When he arrived in Worcester, he immediately rang Maeve's aunt's
              doorbell, who gave him the address of an apartment where Maeve had
              moved.<br /><br />
              Desmond, too, was now walking through the narrow streets that
              Maeve and Rian had passed. He passed a café bearing her name,
              Maeve's Café. Desmond pinched himself in the arm. Could this be a
              coincidence?<br /><br />

              /><br /><br />
              He stopped and stared at the small, charming restaurant, bathed in
              warm light. "She impresses me more and more," he whispered as he
              entered the café. Maeve looked up when she saw Desmond. For a
              moment, the world seemed to stand still. Their eyes met, full of
              longing, pain, and love. <br /><br />
              "Desmond," she whispered, her voice barely more than a breath,
              "how did you get here? Isn't today your wedding?"<br />
              He stepped closer, his heart pounding loudly. "I've missed you so
              much. I just can't be without you, Maeve." <br /><br />
              He slowly knelt before her, his hand seeking hers. "I only want
              one thing: to have you with me. Will you be my wife, Maeve? Will
              you share the future with me, no matter what?" <br />Maeve
              hesitated for a moment, tears streaming down her cheeks. Then she
              smiled weakly, placing her trembling hand on his shoulder. "Why
              should I marry you? I thought you loved your fiancée?"
              <br /><br />
              "No, Maeve, I couldn't marry her. I only love you. I beg you,
              become my wife," he answered honestly, his voice firm. "Because
              you are the best thing that ever happened to me. And because I
              know that together we can accomplish anything."
              <br /><br />
              She closed her eyes, took a deep breath, then helped him up. Their
              faces moved closer, their lips meeting in a tender but passionate
              kiss. "Yes," Maeve breathed, overjoyed, "I do." <br /><br />
              And in that moment a new life began for both of them.
              <br /><br />
